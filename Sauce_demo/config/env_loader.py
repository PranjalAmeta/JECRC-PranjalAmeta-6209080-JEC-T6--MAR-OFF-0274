# env_loader.py  file is created to access the env.qa/.dev files
# the env.qa/.dev is created so that we don't need to pass the values like first_name/last_name all the time in .robot file
# we can just edit the env.qa/.dev files and run the .py loader file to run the test scripts
# Each prod env will have its own unique url, password, api_key, etc for security practices.
